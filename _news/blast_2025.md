I had the opportunity to speak on a panel about career paths in science and engineering for the 2025 [Building Leaders for Advancing Science and Technology (BLAST) program](https://spacegrant.org/sg_programs/blast/) at UVA! I enjoyed a thoughtful conversation with 80 rising 9th and 10th grade students, sharing my experiences and exploring the many possibilities ahead in STEM.
