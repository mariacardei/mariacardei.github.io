Hi, I'm Maria. I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) advised by Professor [Afsaneh Doryab](https://www.afsanehdoryab.com/) in the [Human-AI Technology Lab](https://hai-lab-uva.github.io/). I graduated Cum Laude from the University of Florida in May of 2023 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. My research interests include **computational behavior modeling** and **computer vision and AI for healthcare.**
